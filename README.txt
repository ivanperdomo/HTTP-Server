File in question is http-server.c. All other files are helper files provided by the instructor.
Unfortunately I no longer have access to the server on which the HTML page and database are hosted so this code cannot be run without significant modification.

Http-server accomplishes two things:

1) Serves static contents - HTML and image files (only supports GET method)
2) Serves dynamic contents - Takes user input (lookup query) and returns matching entries from database made available on course server.
